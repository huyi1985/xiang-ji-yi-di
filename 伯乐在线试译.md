= 7 IT career rules worth breaking

== 1. Longer hours equal greater success.

Hard work is a prerequisite for most IT positions, but that doesn’t mean that more hours is always better. An extreme work schedule can actually lower your overall productivity by wearing you out and leading to burnout. Regularly working late also might be a sign that you’re not managing your time well. Talk to your supervisor about reprioritizing projects, delegating assignments or bringing in extra resources.

== 2. Stick to one specialty and get great at it.

IT will always rely on experts in specific technologies, but succeeding in today’s environment also requires an ability to expand beyond your job description as needed. Don’t pass up training opportunities or projects that can help round out your skill set. By demonstrating that you’re eager to expand your core abilities, you make yourself more likely to be considered when a chance for advancement arises.

== 3. Grab any new responsibilities.

On the other hand, a can-do attitude won’t move your career forward if you take on work that you can’t, in fact, do. Indiscriminately volunteering for projects that extend beyond your current abilities can create headaches for the entire IT team. Ask yourself whether you have the appropriate skills and experience for the job. Instead of volunteering to lead a project, would it make more sense to play a supporting role in which you can learn as you go?
