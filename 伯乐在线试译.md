# 7 IT career rules worth breaking

# 7 值得打破的IT职业陈规

## 1. Longer hours equal greater success.

## 1、工作的时间越长成就越大

Hard work is a prerequisite for most IT positions, but that doesn’t mean that more hours is always better. An extreme work schedule can actually lower your overall productivity by wearing you out and leading to burnout. Regularly working late also might be a sign that you’re not managing your time well. Talk to your supervisor about reprioritizing projects, delegating assignments or bringing in extra resources.

虽然努力工作是绝大数IT岗位的先决条件，但是这并不代表工作的时间越长效果越好。一个排得满满的工作计划实际上会使你感到疲惫不堪、精疲力竭，从而降低整体的工作效率。经常性地工作到很晚也许也是一种提醒你没有安排好时间的信号。不如和你的主管谈一谈对策，或是调整项目的优先级，或是把项目委派给你的下级，再或是在项目中加入新的资源。

## 2. Stick to one specialty and get great at it.

IT will always rely on experts in specific technologies, but succeeding in today’s environment also requires an ability to expand beyond your job description as needed. Don’t pass up training opportunities or projects that can help round out your skill set. By demonstrating that you’re eager to expand your core abilities, you make yourself more likely to be considered when a chance for advancement arises.

## 3. Grab any new responsibilities.

On the other hand, a can-do attitude won’t move your career forward if you take on work that you can’t, in fact, do. Indiscriminately volunteering for projects that extend beyond your current abilities can create headaches for the entire IT team. Ask yourself whether you have the appropriate skills and experience for the job. Instead of volunteering to lead a project, would it make more sense to play a supporting role in which you can learn as you go?
